This lack of support is troubling, considering that the Trudeau government purports to welcome migrants and refugees to Canada and has made the promotion of democracy and human rights a cornerstone of its political platform.
We conclude that digital transnational repression has a serious impact on these communities, including their ability to undertake transnational advocacy work related to human rights. Yet, there is little support for victims and policy efforts to date have been insufficient.
Relying on a series of interviews with targets, the report investigates the political, legal, and psychosocial elements of digital transnational repression.
