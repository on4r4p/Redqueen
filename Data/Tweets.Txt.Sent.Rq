This lack of support is troubling, considering that the Trudeau government purports to welcome migrants and refugees to Canada and has made the promotion of democracy and human rights a cornerstone of its political platform.
We conclude that digital transnational repression has a serious impact on these communities, including their ability to undertake transnational advocacy work related to human rights. Yet, there is little support for victims and policy efforts to date have been insufficient.
Relying on a series of interviews with targets, the report investigates the political, legal, and psychosocial elements of digital transnational repression.

E.g., this will highlight matches in red:&lt;foo.log grep 'success|$' -EPiping that to less(1), though, makes the color go away and defeats the purpose. This will highlight and put it in a pager, still with color:&lt;foo.log grep 'success|$' -E --color=always | less -R
Lots of tools (including grep and jq) can colorize their output but disable color if their stdout is a pipe. Usually they'll have a flag to force color output ("grep --color=always" and "jq -C") specifically for this use case.
I've mentioned "less -R" in passing in a couple of #bashTricks threads, but I think it deserves more attention. The -R flag tells less(1) to output raw bytes instead of printing escapes for things like color changes. This lets your terminal show colors in a pager!

Want to get a job in tech. Here are the 4 steps that I always share:- Have a strong LinkedIn- Portfolio Site- Portfolio/GitHub Project(s)- ResumeDon't spend $1000+ on any of this.Need help with any of this? Here are some 100% free resources that can help you out!
I feel like everyone just kind of over emphasises how important Javascript, React, Node etc.But don't underestimate what you can do with just HTML &amp; CSS! Don't feel bad if that is all you know &amp; you are trying to race to the next point.You can make mind blowing sites with it!
How do we do that?Here is the demo. I just found a posting on linkedin.I went to the search bar and typed "hiring Java Developers" since that is what I would have done for my very first job. I had my skillset in Javascript and Java trying to find a fullstack or backend role.
What are some of the apps on your phone that you can't imagine deleting and why? Not the obvious ones like social media but the other apps.Would love to find some good suggestions.

Idly wondering when FR24 and FlightAware are going to create a GPS interference report product. The data's been right there all this time! I'm sure they can make better maps than me.
Based on ADS-B data, I saw maybe a dozen or two aircraft affected by GPS interference over Finland, and probably hundreds affected over Lithuania, Poland, and Latvia. Maybe there just haven't been English-language media reports about it?
Looking a little closer at GPS interference happening in south Texas. It's been happening every day for a month, except on weekends‚Äîand Presidents' Day! Seems like short-range GPS jamming in MOAs for Laughlin AFB and Randolph AFB. https://t.co/KV5szeYbz4
